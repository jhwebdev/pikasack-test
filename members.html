			<h1>iAsianRice:</h1>
			<p>The one who likes rice, and he shoots anybody who gets in the way of his rice. iAsianRice has been through many different phases throughout his internet gaming career, he went from being someone who watches people play to one of the best video game players on the internet. He always wants to play a fair game with everyone, but doesn't hesitate to bring his best to give his team the upper-hand in whatever situation they are in.

		<div class="unirift-avatar"><img src="images/unirift.png"></div>
		<div class="unirift-info">
			<h1>Unirift:</h1>
			<p>The one who plays with strategy and loves longer range combat. Unlike Pikasack and iAsianRice, Unirift likes to think of all the possible tactics he could use while in the heat of the actions, picking the best tactic that will help him and his team live on to keep fighting any battle. Overall, no one would want to approach him head on in battle, unless they feel like losing. Unirift always puts up a fight, but is always willing to share his secrets if you ask nicely!</p>
